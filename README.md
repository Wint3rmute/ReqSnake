# 🐍 ReqSnake

**Turn your MkDocs documentation into a powerful requirements management system.**

ReqSnake extracts, validates, and visualizes project requirements directly from
your existing Markdown files—no separate tools, no complex setup, no vendor
lock-in.

## Why ReqSnake?

✅ **Low Learning Curve** - Works with Markdown you already know  
✅ **No Migration Needed** - Enhance existing documentation  
✅ **Automatic Validation** - Catch circular dependencies and completion errors  
✅ **Visualizations** - Generates Mermaid diagrams of requirement relationships

## Perfect For

- 📋 **Documentation Teams** managing feature requirements
- 🏗️ **Software Architects** tracking system dependencies
- 🚀 **Project Managers** overseeing deliverable completion
- 🔧 **Engineering Teams** using docs-as-code workflows
- 🏢 **Small-Medium Teams** needing enterprise-grade requirements management without enterprise costs

## 🌟 See It In Action

- **[Requirements](./docs/)** - Browse ReqSnake's self-managed requirements in raw Markdown

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Install the Plugin

> [!WARNING]
> PyPi not yet available, work in progress...

```bash
pip install mkdocs-reqsnake
```

### Configure MkDocs

Add the plugin to your `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - reqsnake
```

### Define Requirements

Add requirements to any Markdown file using blockquote syntax:

```markdown
# My Project Documentation

> REQ-AUTH-1
> The system shall support user authentication.
> critical

> REQ-AUTH-2
> The system shall store user credentials securely.
> child-of: REQ-AUTH-1
> completed

> REQ-API-1
> The system shall provide a REST API.
> child-of: REQ-AUTH-1
```

### Build Your Documentation

```bash
mkdocs build  # or mkdocs serve for development
```

ReqSnake will automatically:

- ✨ Extract all requirements from your documentation
- 📄 Generate individual pages for each requirement with dependency diagrams
- 📊 Create a requirements index with completion statistics
- 🗂️ Integrate everything into your MkDocs site navigation
- ⚠️ Validate dependencies and catch errors
  - Circular dependencies
  - Invalid requirement IDs
  - Unmet completion of child requirements

## 🚀 Key Features

### **Requirements Parsing & Validation**

- **Blockquote-based syntax** - Human-readable, easy to edit
- **Duplicate ID detection** - Prevents conflicts across files
- **Circular dependency checking** - Catches impossible requirement chains
- **Completion validation** - Ensures parent requirements can't be completed before children

### **Rich Visualizations**

- **Mermaid diagrams** - See requirement relationships at a glance
- **Hierarchical organization** - Automatic categorization by requirement prefix
- **Completion tracking** - Progress statistics throughout your documentation
- **Parent-child navigation** - Easy browsing of requirement dependencies

### **Seamless Integration**

- **MkDocs plugin architecture** - Should work with any MkDocs theme
- **Automatic navigation** - Requirements appear in your site menu
- **File filtering** - `.requirementsignore` support for excluding files
- **Source file linking** - Generated pages link back to original documentation

### **Developer-Friendly**

- **No external dependencies** - Only requires MkDocs and Python standard library
- **Comprehensive testing** - 96%+ test coverage with 105+ tests

## 📄 What Are Requirements?

Requirements define what you should deliver as a result of your project. Citing [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management):

> In engineering, a requirement is a condition that must be satisfied
> for the output of a work effort to be acceptable. It is an explicit,
> objective, clear and often quantitative description of a condition
> to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.

If you're new to requirements management, think of them like [User
Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story), but more formalized and
with dependencies—a dependency tree to be specific!

### 🤔 Why Track Requirements?

Requirements are usually broken down into smaller sub-requirements, which are
tackled by teams/engineers and delivered separately. Requirements management
tools help you:

- 📋 **Manage the breakdown** of large goals into actionable tasks
- 🔗 **Trace dependencies** between different parts of your system
- ✅ **Track completion** as sub-requirements are delivered
- 🎯 **Ensure nothing is missed** in complex interdisciplinary projects

## 💎 Why Choose ReqSnake Over Alternatives?

### 🏢 Enterprise Tools Are Overkill

Huge, expensive, proprietary programs like [IBM
DOORS](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/engineering-lifecycle-management-suite/doors/9.7.0?topic=overview-doors),
[Enterprise Architect](https://sparxsystems.com/), and [Jama
Software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/) are designed for massive organizations
with complex approval workflows.

### 🐍 ReqSnake Is Right-Sized

Perfect for the large niche of medium-sized projects done by single teams or
small/medium companies where Markdown is already the documentation standard.

- **Free and open-source** vs. expensive licensing
- **Works with existing docs** vs. requiring migration to proprietary formats
- **Simple Markdown syntax** vs. complex GUI workflows
- **Version control friendly** vs. opaque binary formats
- **Theme integration** vs. ugly, outdated interfaces
