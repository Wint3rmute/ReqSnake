# 🐍 ReqSnake

ReqSnake is a **MkDocs plugin** that automatically extracts and displays requirements from your Markdown documentation.

## 📄 But what is a requirement?

Citing [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management):

> In engineering, a requirement is a condition that must be satisfied
> for the output of a work effort to be acceptable. It is an explicit,
> objective, clear and often quantitative description of a condition
> to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.

Proper specification of requirements is a critical field in Systems
Engineering, especially when coordinating interdisciplinary projects.

### 🤔 Why track requirements?

Requirements define what you should deliver as a result of your
project. They are usually broken down into smaller sub-requirements,
which are tackled by teams/engineers and delivered separately.
Requirements management tools help you manage the process of breaking
down requirements and trace how the completion of sub-requirements
results in completion of high-level project goals.

If you're completely new to requirements management, think about them like
[User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story), but more formalized
and with dependencies. A dependency tree to be specific!

## ✍️ Requirements Syntax in ReqSnake

Suppose you have existing project documentation in Markdown, a loose set of
notes, or something like a MkDocs website. Open up your docs and start defining
requirements as Markdown blockquotes in any file you see fit. Example:

```
> REQ-CORE-1
> ReqSnake shall parse requirements from MkDocs Markdown files using blockquote syntax.
> critical

> REQ-CORE-2
> A valid requirement is a blockquote with unique requirement ID as the first line, requirement description as a second line and additional fields as lines below.
> critical

> REQ-CORE-3
> Each requirement ID shall be in a form of "<STRING>-<NUMBER>". Where NUMBER is an integer.
> child-of REQ-CORE-2
> critical

> REQ-PARSER-1
> The Markdown parser shall extract requirements from Markdown blockquotes compliant with the specified format.
> child-of: REQ-CORE-1
> child-of: REQ-CORE-2
> child-of: REQ-CORE-3
```

That's all you have to do to start working with ReqSnake! Simply extend your
existing Markdown documentation with requirements definition and start tracing
what you're building.

From now on, ReqSnake will:

- Check dependencies of requirements before letting you mark them as completed
- Report errors when attempting to complete a requirement with uncompleted child dependencies
- Raise errors upon encountering duplicate requirement IDs
- Generate reports showing the status of requirements and their dependencies
- Help you review the changes you've made to dependencies

## ⚡ Installation & quick-start guide

### Install the Plugin

```bash
# Install the MkDocs ReqSnake plugin
pip install mkdocs-reqsnake
```

### Configure MkDocs

Add the plugin to your `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
# This part here!
plugins:
  - reqsnake
```

### Define Requirements

Add requirements to any of your Markdown files using the blockquote syntax:

```markdown
# My Project Documentation

This is my project documentation.

> REQ-1
> The system shall support user authentication.
> critical

> REQ-2
> The system shall store user credentials securely.
> child-of: REQ-1
> completed
```

### Build Your Documentation

```bash
# Build your documentation site
mkdocs build

# Or serve it locally for development
mkdocs serve
```

ReqSnake will automatically:

- Extract all requirements from your documentation
- Generate individual pages for each requirement
- Create a requirements index page
- Integrate requirements into your site navigation

## 💎 Value Proposition

Between small, one-person projects and huge corporate enterprise-grade
software, there's a large niche of medium-sized projects. They may be done by a
single team or by a small/medium company. Across such projects, Markdown is a
widely used tool, mostly for documentation. There's a ton of amazing Markdown
tooling around:

- 📚 [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- 🗒️ [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)
- 🏗️ [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- 🦄 [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)
- ✨ You name it!

However, I found a piece missing - ability to manage project requirements
within my Markdown documentation!

### 🏢 What software exists currently?

Huge, expensive, proprietary programs like:

- [IBM DOORS](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/engineering-lifecycle-management-suite/doors/9.7.0?topic=overview-doors)
- [Enterprise architect](https://sparxsystems.com/)
- [Jama Software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/)

### 🐍 How is `ReqSnake` better?

- It's free and open-source
- **Seamless MkDocs integration** - requirements become part of your documentation
- **No separate tooling** - works directly within your existing documentation workflow
- **Automatic generation** - requirement pages are created automatically
- **Theme integration** - uses your existing MkDocs theme and styling
- **No migration needed** - works with your existing Markdown files

Want extra functionality? Use the Python API directly:

```python
from mkdocs_reqsnake.reqsnake import _parse_requirements_from_markdown

# Parse requirements from any Markdown content
requirements = _parse_requirements_from_markdown(markdown_content)
for requirement in requirements:
    print(f"Processing {requirement.req_id}: {requirement.description}")
```

## 📖 Examples

ReqSnake's requirements are managed by ReqSnake! See the [requirements directory](./docs/).

ReqSnake's dependency status, generated by ReqSnake: [requirements-status.md](./requirements-status.md).

## 🚀 Features

- **MkDocs Plugin**: Seamlessly integrates with your existing documentation
- **Automatic Generation**: Creates requirement pages and navigation automatically
- **Blockquote-based Markdown syntax**: Human-readable, easy to edit
- **Requirements hierarchy**: Use `child-of` to define relationships
- **Validation**: Checks for duplicate IDs, circular dependencies, and completion rules
- **No Dependencies**: Only requires MkDocs and the Python standard library
